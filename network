I used the Modernist Project-"The Crisis" magazine dataset compiled by Melanie Walsh. 
There were no specific information about the nodes and edges, but I figured that they are author names that publish frequently together in the issues based on the description below:  

"The issues included in the MJP and this network data span from 1910-1922, a time period during which the magazine covered "most every facet of life for blacks in America, devoting special issues to such topics as women's suffrage, education, children, labor, homes, vacations, and the war." The magazine also became "an important crucible" for the literary and arts movement known as the Harlem Renaissance.

Notable authors who published in The Crisis and are included in this dataset: W. E. B. Du Bois, Jessie Fauset, Charles Chestnutt, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Claude McKay, and more."

These are my visualizations from Network Navigator:
